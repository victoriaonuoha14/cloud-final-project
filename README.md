(Accessible on port 80 only â€” no port number required)

Project Overview
Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Backend: Node.js + Express REST API 
Containerization: Docker with multi-stage builds
Orchestration: docker-compose.yml for local and cloud deployment
CI/CD: GitHub Actions automates build, push, and deployment
Cloud: Deployed on Azure Ubuntu VM with public IP

Build Process

npm install â†’ installs dependencies (node_modules)
npm run build â†’ generates production-ready dist/ folder
Docker uses multi-stage builds to deploy only the dist/ output
Frontend served via Nginx; backend runs as Node.js service

Features
Add, delete, and mark todos as complete or pending
Real-time data loading from backend API (/api/tasks)
Clean, responsive UI
Fully automated deployment pipeline
